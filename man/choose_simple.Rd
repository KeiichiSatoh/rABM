\title{Random Samples with Weighted Probability}
\usage{
choose_simple(x, size = 1, prob = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of elements to choose from.}

\item{size}{A non-negative integer indicating the number of items to select. Default is 1.}

\item{prob}{A vector of probability weights for selecting elements from the vector.
If set to \code{NULL} (the default), all elements have an equal chance of selection.}
}
\description{
A streamlined version of \code{sample} designed to speed up selection
during simulations. Sampling is performed without replacement.
}
\details{
This function selects one or more items from a set of candidates based on
weighted probabilities, useful in simulations where agents choose an option.

Functions that accommodate a wide range of inputs often run slower due to
extensive checks. Reducing such checks and pre-processing steps
typically increases execution speed.

This function bypasses certain preparatory procedures within "sample.int" and
is specifically optimized for scalar selection,
achieving approximately 1.5 to 2 times faster performance.
